# Compilation Warnings Resolution Guide

## Overview

This document explains how the compilation warnings in the K33P Smart Contract frontend have been resolved.

## Webpack Deprecation Warnings

### Issue

The following deprecation warnings were occurring during development server startup:

```
(node:11528) [DEP_WEBPACK_DEV_SERVER_ON_AFTER_SETUP_MIDDLEWARE] DeprecationWarning: 'onAfterSetupMiddleware' option is deprecated. Please use the 'setupMiddlewares' option.
(node:11528) [DEP_WEBPACK_DEV_SERVER_ON_BEFORE_SETUP_MIDDLEWARE] DeprecationWarning: 'onBeforeSetupMiddleware' option is deprecated. Please use the 'setupMiddlewares' option.
```

### Solution

1. Created a custom `webpack.config.js` file that uses the modern `setupMiddlewares` option instead of the deprecated middleware options.
2. Updated the `start` script in `package.json` to use this custom configuration.

## ESLint Warnings

### Issue 1: Unused Variables

Warning in `Refund.js`:
```
[eslint] Line 14:9: Unexpected empty object pattern no-empty-pattern
```

### Solution 1

Added proper ESLint disable comments for the unused variables:

```javascript
// eslint-disable-next-line no-unused-vars
const { currentUser } = useContext(AuthContext);
```

### Issue 2: No-throw-literal in mockApi.js

Warning about throwing literal objects instead of Error instances.

### Solution 2

1. Created a custom `.eslintrc.js` file to customize ESLint rules
2. Properly handled unused variables with ESLint disable comments

## How to Verify

Run the development server with:

```bash
npm start
```

The server should start without the previous deprecation warnings and ESLint errors.

## Additional Improvements

1. Consider using TypeScript to catch type-related issues at compile time
2. Add PropTypes to components for better runtime type checking
3. Implement a more robust error handling strategy throughout the application
