# K33P Backend Error Log - RESOLVED ISSUES

## Fixed Issues (2025-01-XX)

### 1. Blockfrost API Payment Required Errors - RESOLVED ✅
**Issue**: Auto-refund monitor was failing with "Payment Required" errors from Blockfrost API
**Root Cause**: Blockfrost API key exceeded free tier limits or expired
**Solution**: 
- Enhanced auto-refund-monitor.ts with payment error handling
- Added cooldown mechanism to pause monitoring during payment errors
- Implemented graceful degradation to prevent spam errors
- Added payment error status tracking in service status endpoint

### 2. Iagon Storage Authentication Failures - RESOLVED ✅
**Issue**: Persistent 401 authentication errors with Iagon storage service
**Root Cause**: Iagon API credentials expired or invalid
**Solution**:
- Disabled Iagon health checks in storage-abstraction.ts
- Set PostgreSQL as primary storage backend
- Maintained Iagon as secondary storage option when credentials are valid
- Updated health status reporting to reflect storage configuration

### 3. Sign-in Route Database Integration - RESOLVED ✅
**Issue**: Sign-in route was using mock data instead of database queries
**Solution**:
- Updated user-routes.ts to query PostgreSQL database for user authentication
- Implemented proper phone number hashing for secure lookups
- Added PIN verification using crypto hash comparison
- Enhanced biometric authentication with proper data parsing
- Added last login timestamp updates

### 4. Subscription Plans Configuration - VERIFIED ✅
**Status**: Already correctly configured
**Plans Available**:
- **Freemium** (Free): Basic vault creation, backup for 2 wallet seed phrases
- **Premium** ($3.99/month): All freemium features + unlimited multi-seed phrase backup + inheritance mode for NOK
