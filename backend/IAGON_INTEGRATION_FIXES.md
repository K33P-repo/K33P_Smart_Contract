# Iagon Integration Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Wrong Authentication Method
**Problem**: The code was using an API key (`IAGON_API_KEY`) with Bearer token authentication.

**Solution**: Updated to use Personal Access Token (`IAGON_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN`) as required by Iagon.

**Changes Made**:
- Updated `.env` file to use `IAGON_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` instead of `IAGON_API_KEY`
- Modified `iagon.js` and `iagon.ts` to use the new token variable
- Added instructions to generate token from https://app.iagon.com/ settings page

### 2. Wrong API Base URL
**Problem**: Using `https://api.iagon.com` which doesn't match their actual API structure.

**Solution**: Updated to use the correct base URL `https://gw.iagon.com/api/v2`

**Changes Made**:
- Updated `IAGON_API_URL` in `.env` file
- This matches the official Iagon API documentation

### 3. Non-existent Endpoints
**Problem**: Code was trying to use `/users` endpoint which doesn't exist in Iagon API v2.

**Solution**: Updated implementation to use mock data with proper warnings.

**Changes Made**:
- Modified `findUser`, `createUser`, and `findUserById` functions
- Added warning messages explaining the API limitation
- Implemented fallback to mock data for all user operations

## Current Status

### What Works Now
- ✅ Correct authentication method (Personal Access Token)
- ✅ Correct API base URL
- ✅ Proper error handling and fallback to mock data
- ✅ Clear warnings about API limitations

### What Still Needs Work
- ❌ Proper integration with Iagon's actual storage endpoints
- ❌ User data storage using Iagon's file/object storage
- ❌ Mapping K33P user management to Iagon storage services

## Next Steps for Full Integration

### 1. Generate Personal Access Token
1. Visit https://app.iagon.com/
2. Log in to your account
3. Go to Settings page
4. Generate a Personal Access Token
5. Update `.env` file: `IAGON_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_token_here`

### 2. Understand Iagon's Storage Model
Based on the API documentation, Iagon focuses on:
- File/object storage services
- API key management for storage access
- Storage node operations

### 3. Redesign User Data Storage
Instead of traditional user management endpoints, consider:
- Storing user data as JSON files in Iagon storage
- Using file-based operations for user CRUD
- Implementing a custom user management layer on top of storage

### 4. Example Implementation Strategy
```javascript
// Instead of POST /users, use storage operations:
// 1. Create user data as JSON
const userData = { id, walletAddress, phoneHash, ... };

// 2. Store as file in Iagon storage
const fileName = `users/${userId}.json`;
const result = await iagonStorage.uploadFile(fileName, JSON.stringify(userData));

// 3. For user lookup, download and parse the file
const userFile = await iagonStorage.downloadFile(`users/${userId}.json`);
const user = JSON.parse(userFile.content);
```

## Testing the Current Setup

### 1. Test with Mock Data (Current)
- The system will use mock data and log warnings
- All user operations will work locally
- No actual Iagon API calls for user management

### 2. Test API Connectivity
- Set `IAGON_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` in `.env`
- Check logs for successful API client creation
- Verify token authentication works

## Files Modified

1. **`.env`**
   - Changed `IAGON_API_KEY` to `IAGON_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN`
   - Updated `IAGON_API_URL` to correct endpoint
   - Added setup instructions

2. **`backend/src/utils/iagon.js`**
   - Updated authentication method
   - Modified API client creation
   - Added proper error handling and warnings

3. **`backend/src/utils/iagon.ts`**
   - Same changes as JavaScript version
   - Maintained type safety

## Important Notes

- The current implementation uses mock data for all user operations
- This ensures the application continues to work while proper storage integration is developed
- All changes are backward compatible with existing code
- Clear warnings are logged when API is available but mock data is used
