# K33P Smart Contract: Decentralized Identity System

## Introduction

The K33P Smart Contract is a revolutionary decentralized identity (DID) system built on the Cardano blockchain. It provides a secure, private, and user-controlled identity management solution using advanced cryptographic techniques including zero-knowledge proofs.

## Key Components

### 1. Smart Contract Validator

The core of our system is the `k33p_validator` - an Aiken-based smart contract that handles:

- **Identity Management**: Secure storage and verification of user identities
- **Transaction Validation**: Ensuring all operations follow protocol rules
- **Refund Mechanism**: Controlled return of user deposits

### 2. Data Structures

- **AuthData**: Stores phone hash and creation timestamp
  ```
  pub type AuthData {
    phone_hash: ByteArray,
    created_at: Int,
  }
  ```

- **IdentityDatum**: Multi-purpose datum for different operations
  ```
  pub type IdentityDatum {
    SignupDatum(SignupDatumValue)
    RefundDatum(RefundDatumValue)
    DeleteDatum(DeleteDatumValue)
  }
  ```

- **K33pRedeemer**: Action triggers for the smart contract
  ```
  pub type K33pRedeemer {
    AuthRedeemerType(AuthRedeemer)
    IdentityRedeemerType(IdentityRedeemer)
  }
  ```

## Key Functions & Roles

### Validation Functions

- `validate_phone_hash`: Ensures phone hash meets security requirements
- `validate_zk_proof`: Verifies zero-knowledge proof integrity
- `validate_user_id`: Confirms user ID meets length and format requirements
- `validate_timing`: Ensures operations occur within valid time windows
- `validate_wallet_authorization`: Verifies wallet signatures for operations

### Process Functions

- `validate_auth_redeemer_spend`: Handles authentication data operations
- `validate_identity_redeemer_spend`: Processes identity-related transactions
- `validate_signup_refund`: Manages the refund process for user deposits

### Backend Integration

- `BlockchainVerifier`: Verifies on-chain transactions via Blockfrost API
- `EnhancedK33PManager`: Manages user deposits and interactions with the smart contract

## Implementation Highlights

### Security Measures

- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Allow verification without revealing sensitive data
- **Deposit Requirement**: 2 ADA deposit prevents spam and abuse
- **Cryptographic Hashing**: All sensitive data is hashed before storage
- **Time-Bound Operations**: All transactions have validity time windows

### Privacy Features

- **Minimal On-Chain Data**: Only hashed data stored on blockchain
- **Multiple Verification Methods**: Support for phone, PIN, or biometric verification
- **User-Controlled Identity**: Users maintain ownership of their identity data

### API Endpoints

- `/signup`: Records new user signup with transaction verification
- `/retry-verification`: Retries verification for unverified transactions
- `/user/:address/status`: Checks user signup status
- `/admin/process-signup`: Completes the signup process on-chain

## Technical Implementation

### Smart Contract

Written in Aiken, a domain-specific language for Cardano smart contracts, providing:

- Type safety and formal verification
- Efficient execution on Cardano's EUTXO model
- Clear separation of concerns between different validator functions

### Backend

Implemented in TypeScript with:

- Express.js for API endpoints
- Lucid SDK for Cardano blockchain interaction
- Blockfrost API for transaction verification
- Firebase for authentication (optional integration)

## Conclusion

The K33P Smart Contract represents a significant advancement in blockchain-based identity systems. By combining the security of Cardano's EUTXO model with zero-knowledge proofs and a deposit-based anti-spam mechanism, we've created a robust, private, and user-centric identity solution that can serve as the foundation for numerous decentralized applications.
